# Savannah Interview Assignment

The goal of this small project is to create a small webApp displaying users and their related posts (data are located on jsonplaceholder).

Use this project, which has already yarn configured and the table of users implemented. The architecture of the project is up to you. Please code as you would do in your everyday work.

## Specifications
- Add the option to fetch each user posts on jsonplaceholder and display them with their user.
- The name of each user should be editable, and should send the update to the server (note that the update is faked on jsonplaceholder).
- Display the number of users living in an Appt, and in a Suite (field address.suite)
## Rules
- add spinners while information is loading
- use open-sourced tools
- utilize any css method (sass, less, css modules, bootstrap, MUI, ...)
- use Redux or any modern state management module
- split the application into different pages

This demo project is setup with:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A very fast build tool
- [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/): A very fast Tailwind CSS compiler
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/): Form builder and validation library
- [React Modal](http://reactcommunity.org/react-modal/): An accessible modal component
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Promised based HTTP client for browsers
- [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server): Full fake REST API server

I've written a breakdown article for this project which is available on [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/blog/).
